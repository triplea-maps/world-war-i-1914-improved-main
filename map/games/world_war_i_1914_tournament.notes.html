<br>Still work in progress. Not all features are governed by the engine, some require enforcement by the player. Use edit when needed.
<br>
<br><b>Things from the Tournament Rules that have been added:</b>
<ul>
<li>Setup changes.</li>
<li>Increased movement for land units (though needs player enforcement for some cases).</li>
<li>Port gives +1 movement.</li>
</ul>
<br>All movement of land units has been set to 2, however there are some cases where the units can only move 1. Check the rules to see when that is the case.
<br>
<strong>IMPORTANT: The economic/political collapse rules have not been incorporated. Use edit to follow these rules.</strong>
